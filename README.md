# hyperblast
Web app for BBD's vacation work July 2025. Should be a lazer tag app using phones.

## Running the app
The app uses a node backend for websockets. This is found in the backend folder. A react app is used for the frontened. Obviously, this is in the frontend folder.
First make sure that you have all the node packages installed. Do this by running 
```
npm install
```
To get the app running start by enabling the backend server, by running 
```
npm start
```
in the backend folder. (This starts the server).
To run the frontend, also run
```
npm start
```
in the frontend folder.
